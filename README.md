# MVP.css Reimplemented in Tailwind CSS

This fork is a rebuild of MVP.css written in Tailwind CSS mostly to see how hard it'd be. This gives you a great starting point vs. having a blank unstyled document while allowing you to customize everything using TailwindCSS.

You'll want to use PurgeCSS to cut the final file size down to something that's more production ready.

More soon, but enjoy!
